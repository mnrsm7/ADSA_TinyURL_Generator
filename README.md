# ADSA_TinyURL_Generator
A URL shortener converts long URLs into short, shareable links, similar to bit.ly. It uses a hash function to generate a unique short code for each URL. Stack operations manage reusable or expired codes efficiently. The system supports tracking clicks, setting expiration, and providing analytics like total visits and usage patterns.
